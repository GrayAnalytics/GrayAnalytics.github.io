      <description>spark_apply():: Error: Column must have a unique name Did you get excited learning that spark_apply() will let you run your own custom functions in spark?
And then, no matter what, you&amp;rsquo;re getting this joyous error?
Column &#39;[column name]&#39; must have a unique name.  There&amp;rsquo;s a few possible causes:
 You&amp;rsquo;re using the group_by parameter, and the column name actually isn&amp;rsquo;t unique.
 The function you&amp;rsquo;re running through spark_apply() returns multiple rows/values per input.</description>

      <description>OO Designs Was recently taking an Object Oriented Software development class. In the spirit of &amp;lsquo;Learning Out Loud&amp;rsquo; I figured the design patterns would be an interesting blog series.

      <title>Data Synthesis Part 1</title>

      <description>This post is less of a how to and more of an algorithm idea.
Inspired by random walk and monte carlo, I wanted to write an algorithm that could be used to synthetically upsample data that is a mixture of factoral and numeric data, where the columns are not independent.
My original hope was to synthesize factoral combinations.
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Without outside knowledge of what factorial column combinations are allowed, I have to work with the combinations present in the input data.</description>

      <description>This is a bit of an &amp;lsquo;infrastructure&amp;rsquo; post. Helping develop a working environment for future projects.
I prefer storing data in a database vs txt files. But that&amp;rsquo;s me.
Educators My primary source for this is SQLite&amp;rsquo;s quickstart page website.
Tool I briefly considered three databases for this:
 Oracle Lite
 Looks like this requires you to setup a mini-server function on your PC. Sounds like a pain.</description>

      <description>FIRST POST!!! I made a blog, it makes sense that if I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;lsquo;Learning out Loud&amp;rsquo;, my first post should contain what I learned on &amp;lsquo;How to Make a Blog&amp;rsquo;. And based on how poorly this post looks, you know i&amp;rsquo;m not lying about the &amp;lsquo;First Post&amp;rsquo; comment.
Educators My primary source for this is Yihui Xie&amp;rsquo;s website.
Getting Started I&amp;rsquo;m using RStudio as my primary editor.
So you&amp;rsquo;ll want to install</description>

      <description>Who am I I&amp;rsquo;m Dorian Gray (DG).
I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist/analyst who is still learning.
About This Blog Based on David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s (@drob) post of Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog and John Mackintosh&amp;rsquo;s (@HighlandDataSci) post Time to Shine, I decided to start a blog. AND, inspired by Mara Averick&amp;rsquo;s (@dataandme) presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make it a &amp;lsquo;Learning Out Loud&amp;rsquo; blog!
Update Schedule This blog will be updated inconsistently, as I learn or &amp;ldquo;re-learn&amp;rdquo; new skills.</description>
