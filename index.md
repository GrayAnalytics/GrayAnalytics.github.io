Based on David Robinson's ([@drob](https://twitter.com/drob)) post [Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)   
and John Mackintosh's ([@HighlandDataSci](https://twitter.com/HighlandDataSci)) post [Time to Shine](https://www.johnmackintosh.com/2017-12-30-time-to-shine/),  
I decided to start a blog.  

This is also motivated by the Udacity DataScience Nanodegree
