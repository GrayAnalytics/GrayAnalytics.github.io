      <description>This post is less of a how to and more of an algorithm idea.
Inspired by random walk and monte carlo, I wanted to write an algorithm that could be used to synthetically upsample data that is a mixture of factoral and numeric data, where the columns are not independent.
My original hope was to synthesize factoral combinations.
But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Without outside knowledge of what factorial column combinations are allowed, I have to work with the combinations present in the input data.</description>
